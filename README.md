## Problem
Lots of people want to see their GPs, but there aren't enough appointments to see them all.

Lots of GP practices have appointments that are cancelled very last minute and remain unfilled.

Our project helps to bridge this gap, by first suggesting alternatives for a patient's symptoms, e.g. to go to see their pharmacist, often underutilised in the community, and also allows them to book any last minute cancelled appointment in their local area from all the local GPs around.
